Herein	O
we	O
describe	O
transient	O
myocardial	Disease
hypertrophy	Disease
induced	O
by	O
tacrolimus	Chemical
after	O
heart	O
transplantation.	O
The	O
hypertrophy	Disease
caused	O
no	O
clinical	O
symptoms	O
but	O
was	O
noted	O
because	O
of	O

;	O
neither	O

The	O
blood	O
tacrolimus	Chemical
concentration	O
was	O
higher	O
than	O
usual	O
at	O
that	O
time;	O
thus,	O
tacrolimus	Chemical
dosage	O

Myocardial	Disease

completely	O

We	O
have	O

METHODS:	O
The	O
alteration	O
in	O
the	O
NO	Chemical

was	O
assessed	O
by	O
measuring	O

They	O

in	O
the	O

In	O
the	O

were	O

Apoptosis	O
was	O

in	O

However,	O
in	O
the	O
ADR	Chemical

group,	O
numerous	O
apoptotic	O

were	O
identified	O
in	O

Treatment	O
with	O

prevented	O
the	O
impairment	O
of	O

CONCLUSION:	O
We	O
suggest	O
that	O
interactions	O

in	O

The	O

Finally,	O
